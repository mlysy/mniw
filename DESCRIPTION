Description: Density evaluation and random number generation for the Matrix-Normal Inverse-Wishart (MNIW) distribution, as well as the the Matrix-Normal, Matrix-T, Wishart, and Inverse-Wishart distributions.  Core calculations are implemented in a portable (header-only) C++ library, with matrix manipulations using the 'Eigen' library for linear algebra.  Also provided is a Gibbs sampler for Bayesian inference with a random-effects model with multivariate normal observations.
